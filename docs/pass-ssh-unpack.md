# pass-ssh-unpack

Extract SSH keys from Proton Pass to local files and generate SSH config.

## Overview

`pass-ssh-unpack` pulls SSH keys stored in your Proton Pass vaults, saves them to disk with proper permissions, generates matching SSH config entries, and optionally saves derived public keys back to Proton Pass.

**Key features:**
- Incremental updates (only updates entries for unpacked keys)
- Auto-prune (removes config entries whose key files no longer exist)
- Wildcard matching for vault names and item titles
- Machine-specific key filtering (e.g., `github/hostname`)
- Portable paths using SSH's `%d` token
- Password-only entries (items without private keys still get config entries)

## Requirements

- [Proton Pass CLI](https://proton.me/support/pass-cli) (`pass-cli`)
- OpenSSH (`ssh-keygen`)
- `jq` (Bash/Zsh/Fish only)
- Logged into Proton Pass (`pass-cli login`)

## Installation

The command is automatically available when sourcing your shell config files managed by chezmoi.

### Examples

```bash
# Extract all SSH keys from all vaults
pass-ssh-unpack

# Extract all keys from a specific vault
pass-ssh-unpack -v Personal

# Extract from multiple vaults
pass-ssh-unpack -v Personal -v "Dragon Servers"

# Extract from vaults matching a pattern
pass-ssh-unpack -v "Dragon*"

# Extract keys matching a pattern
pass-ssh-unpack -i 'github/*'

# Extract keys matching multiple patterns
pass-ssh-unpack -i 'inmotion*' -i 'thedragon.dev'

# Combine vault and item title patterns
pass-ssh-unpack -v "Dragon*" -i '*.dev'

pass-ssh-unpack --full

# Quiet mode (for scripting)
pass-ssh-unpack -q
```

## Proton Pass SSH Key Structure

Each SSH key item in Proton Pass should have:

### Required Fields

| Field                        | Description                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `content.title`              | Item name (e.g., `github/cachycosmic`) |
| `content.content.SshKey.private_key` | The private key content (can be empty for password auth) |

### Extra Fields (Custom)

Add these as custom text fields in Proton Pass:

| Field Name | Description                                    | Example              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `Host`     | SSH hostname for config **(required)**         | `github.com`         |
| `Username` | SSH user for config                            | `git`                |
| `Aliases`  | Comma-separated alias hostnames                | `gh, github`         |

If `Aliases` is empty, the item title is used as an alias.

## Generated Files

### Directory Structure

```
~/.ssh/proton-pass/
├── config              # SSH config file (Include this in ~/.ssh/config)
├── VaultName/
│   ├── key-title       # Private key (chmod 600)
│   └── key-title.pub   # Public key
└── AnotherVault/
    └── ...
```

### SSH Config Format

```ssh-config
# =============================================================================
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - IT IS AUTO-GENERATED BY pass-ssh-unpack
# =============================================================================
# ...

Host github.com
    IdentityFile "%d/.ssh/proton-pass/Personal/github-cachycosmic"
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User git

# Alias of github.com
Host gh
    IdentityFile "%d/.ssh/proton-pass/Personal/github-cachycosmic"
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    User git
```

### Password-Only Entries

For SSH items that have no private key stored (empty `private_key` field), the command generates a minimal config entry without `IdentityFile` or `IdentitiesOnly`. This allows SSH to prompt for a password.

```ssh-config
Host home.thedragon.dev
    User frosthaven
```

This is useful for servers that use password authentication or when you want to store SSH connection info without the key itself.

### Using the Config

Add this line to your `~/.ssh/config`:

```ssh-config
Include ~/.ssh/proton-pass/config
```

## Behavior

### Incremental Updates (default)

Running without `--full` preserves existing config entries and key files. Only entries for keys that are actually unpacked are updated. This allows you to run the command for a subset of keys without losing other entries.

### Full Regeneration (`--full`)

Running with `--full` deletes the entire `~/.ssh/proton-pass` folder first, then regenerates everything from scratch. Use this when you want a guaranteed clean slate with no orphaned files.

### Auto-Prune

On every run, entries whose referenced key files don't exist on disk are automatically removed from the config. This keeps the config clean when keys are deleted from Proton Pass.

### Machine-Specific Keys

If an item title contains a `/` (e.g., `github/cachycosmic`), the part after the last `/` is compared to the current hostname. The key is only extracted if they match (case-insensitive).

This allows storing multiple machine-specific keys for the same service:
- `github/cachycosmic` - Only extracted on machine `cachycosmic`
- `github/frosthaven-mbp14` - Only extracted on machine `frosthaven-mbp14`

### Public Key Generation

If the `public_key` field in Proton Pass is empty, `pass-ssh-unpack` generates the public key from the private key and attempts to save it back to Proton Pass.

## Troubleshooting

### "pass-cli not found"

Install the Proton Pass CLI from https://proton.me/support/pass-cli

### "Not logged into Proton Pass"

Run `pass-cli login` to authenticate.

### "ssh-keygen not found"

Install OpenSSH. On most systems this is pre-installed.

### "jq not found" (Bash/Zsh/Fish only)

Install `jq`:
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S jq`
- macOS: `brew install jq`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install jq`

### Keys not appearing in config

1. Ensure the item has a `Host` field in extra_fields
2. Check if the item title has a machine suffix that doesn't match your hostname
3. Run with `--full` to do a clean regeneration

### Permission denied errors

SSH requires private keys to have strict permissions. The command sets `chmod 600` automatically, but if issues persist, verify permissions manually:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/proton-pass/VaultName/key-name
```
